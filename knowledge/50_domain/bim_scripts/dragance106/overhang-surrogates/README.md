## overhang_surrogates: a Python package for sampling, training and visualising surrogate models for building energy simulations

The package, which can be installed by `pip install overhang_surrogates`, contains selected methods that:
- offer Python implementation of the iterative sampling method mc-intersite-proj-th (MIPT) proposed in 
  K Crombecq, E Laermans, T Dhaene,
  *Efficient space-filling and non-collapsing sequential design strategies for simulation-based modeling*,
  Eur J Oper Res 214 (2011), 683-696,
- simplify training of XGBoost and ANN surrogate models with *k*-fold cross validation for a given pandas dataframe, and
- produce visually appealing 3D diagrams for selected columns using vedo.

It consists of the following main methods:

---

`mipt(n, dim=2, alpha=0.5, k=100)`

This method is the basic implementation of the MIPT sampling method (MIPT). 
Candidate points are chosen from the entire hypercube [0,1]^dim.

**Parameters:**
- `n` — the sample size to generate.
- `dim` — the dimension of the space from which samples are drawn.
- `alpha` — tolerance parameter for the minimal *projected* distance: any candidate point whose projected distance is less than `alpha / n` is discarded from consideration.
- `k` — factor that determines the number of candidate points (in the `i`-th iteration `k*i` candidate points are generated).

**Returns:** an array of `n` points from the hypercube [0,1]^dim.

---

`mipt_full(n, dim=2, alpha=0.5, k=100, negligible=1e-6)`

This implements a version of MIPT in which new candidate points are sampled **only** from the allowed intervals obtained after removing from the hypercube [0,1]^dim the smaller hypercubes that cover the minimal projected distance around already selected sample points.

**Parameters:**
- `n`, `dim`, `alpha`, `k` have the same meaning as in `mipt`.
- `negligible` — a value considered negligible when comparing interval bounds (used to handle numerical edge cases).

**Returns:** an array of `n` points from the hypercube [0,1]^dim.

---

`mipt_extend(current, n, alpha=0.5, k=100, negligible=1e-6)`

Extends an existing sample given by `current`, which is a NumPy array (e.g. `np.array([[0.5,0.5,0.5], [0.25,0.25,0.25], [0.75,0.75,0.75]])`). 
New candidate points are picked only from the allowed intervals as in `mipt_full`.

- `n`, `alpha`, `k`, `negligible` have the same meaning as above.
- `dim` is inferred from the dimensionality of the rows in the `current` NumPy array.

**Returns:** the input sample `current` augmented with `n` new points from [0,1]^dim.

---

`add_overhang(idf, window_name, height, depth, width)`

Adds an overhang to an `eppy` IDF object `idf`. 
The overhang is placed `height` meters above the window named `window_name`.
It has depth of `depth` meters and width of `width` meters, and 
it is centered on the window and attached to the wall that contains the window.

**Assumptions:** the window `window_name` belongs to an exterior wall and the window is rectangular with all four edges either horizontal or vertical.

---

`create_obstacle(idf, x, y, z, dist, left, right, up)`

Creates a southern obstacle — an `EnergyPlus` object of type `Shading:Site:Detailed` — that blocks direct sunlight.
The obstacle is created relative to the reference point `(x, y, z)` and placed `dist` meters to the south.
The view to the south is blocked `left` degrees to the left, `right` degrees to the right, and `up` degrees upward.
The new shading object is then added to the existing `idf` object.

---

`sample_and_simulate_overhangs(idf_filename, epw_filename, window_name, depth_range, height_range, width, sample_size, idd_filename='Energy+.idd', delete_output_files=True)`

This method creates a sample of size `sample_size` for overhang depths and heights. 
Depths are chosen from `depth_range`; heights are chosen from `height_range`.
For each sampled (depth, height) pair it:
   - builds an `idf` object from `idf_filename` and `epw_filename`,
   - adds the corresponding overhang to that `idf`,
   - simulates the `idf` using the `eppy` library,
   - collects values of the meters defined in the `idf` via `Output:Meter` commands (e.g. `Output:Meter,DistrictHeating:Facility,RunPeriod;`).
The method further combines all collected meter values into a single `pandas` `DataFrame`,
indexed by the sampled depths and heights, with columns corresponding to meters present in `idf_filename`.

**Other parameters:**
- `window_name` — the name of the window above which overhangs are placed.
- `depth_range` — array of possible overhang depths (meters) from which the sample is drawn. If you have `min_depth`, `max_depth`, and `num_of_values`, you can generate it as:
  ```python
  depth_range = np.linspace(min_depth, max_depth, num_of_values).round(decimals=2)
  ```
  The rounding (`round(decimals=2)`) is suggested for nicer display (fewer unnecessary decimals).
- `height_range` — analogous array for possible overhang heights; same generation suggestion applies.
- `width` — the overhang width (meters).
- `idd_filename` — path to the EnergyPlus IDD file. Default `'Energy+.idd'` implies a copy of this file should exist in the current directory.
- `delete_output_files` — whether to delete files produced by EnergyPlus after the simulations. Set to `False` only if you need to inspect those files afterwards.

**Returns:** a `pandas.DataFrame` with all collected meter predictions.

---

`train_model_ensembles(df, input_cols, meter_cols, num_folds=5, learning_rate=0.1, early_stopping_rounds=10)`

Given a `pandas.DataFrame` `df`, this method trains models using the columns in `input_cols` as inputs. 
For each column listed in `meter_cols` it trains a separate **XGBoost ensemble**.
Training uses mean squared error (MSE) as the loss method.
Cross-validation with `num_folds` splits is used; 
therefore for each output column the ensemble is represented as a list of `num_folds` XGBoost models.
The parameter `learning_rate` controls the XGBoost learning rate — smaller values allow finer fit but typically require more trees.
Training stops early after `early_stopping_rounds` iterations if there is no improvement in predictive accuracy.

**Returns:** a dictionary of XGBoost ensembles; each key is a meter name from `meter_cols` and the value is the corresponding ensemble (list of models).

---

`predict_meters(ensembles, input_ranges)`

**Parameters:**
- `ensembles` — a dictionary where each key is a meter name and each value is the XGBoost ensemble that predicts that meter.
- The ensemble prediction is the mean of predictions of all models in the ensemble.
- `input_ranges` — a dictionary where each key is an input variable name and each value is an array of possible values for that input.

The method forms the Cartesian product of all input value arrays,
and for each meter it predicts the values for all combinations of input values.
It then returns a `pandas.DataFrame` containing all predictions.

**Example**
```python
input_ranges = {
  'depth':  np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10).round(decimals=1),
  'height': np.linspace(0.1, 0.5, 5).round(decimals=1)
}
```
This would create a Cartesian product of the two arrays containing 50 `(depth, height)` pairs, 
make an ensemble prediction for each pair, and return a DataFrame with the predictions.

`make_3d_diagram(df, xcol, ycol, zcol, minxvalue=None, maxxvalue=None, numxticks=10, minyvalue=None, maxyvalue=None, numyticks=10, minzvalue=None, maxzvalue=None, numzticks=10, filename=None, light=None, camera=(-15, 25), aspect_ratio=(1, 1, 1), palette=colorcet.CET_L20, distance_multiplier=4, num_isolines=25, padding=0.001, interactive=False, diagram_size='auto', **kwargs)`

Creates a 3D diagram for the data contained in columns `xcol`, `ycol` and `zcol` of the `pandas.DataFrame` `df`.
The final diagram is saved to `filename`. If `interactive=True`, the diagram is displayed in interactive mode using `vedo`.

**Assumption:** the DataFrame contains exactly one row for every pair in the Cartesian product of the unique values that appear in `xcol` and `ycol`.

**Parameter descriptions**
- `minxvalue` — smallest x-axis tick. If `None`, set to `min(df[xcol])`.
- `maxxvalue` — largest x-axis tick. If `None`, set to `max(df[xcol])`.
- `numxticks` — number of ticks on the x-axis (including min and max).
- `minyvalue`, `maxyvalue`, `numyticks` — analogous settings for the y-axis.
- `minzvalue`, `maxzvalue`, `numzticks` — analogous settings for the z-axis.
- `filename` — output filename for the diagram.
  If `None`, the file will be written in the current directory as `diagram_<xcol>_<ycol>_<zcol>.png`
  (If a file with that name already exists it will be overwritten.)
- `light` — a `vedo` light object (`Light`). If `None`, a light is constructed internally to illuminate the plot from above.
- `camera` — either a `vedo` camera parameter dictionary or a pair `(azimuth, height)` in degrees:
  - `height` is the angle between the xy-plane and the camera position,
  - `azimuth` is the angle in the xy-plane between the camera position and south (negative y-axis).
- `aspect_ratio` — ratio between x-width, y-depth and z-height of the plot. Internally normalized so the smallest value equals 1.
- `palette` — a colormap for the diagram. See Colorcet continuous maps (recommended: `colorcet.CET_L3`, `CET_L7`, `CET_L17`, `CET_L20`).
- `distance_multiplier` — if `camera` is given as `(azimuth, height)`,
  this sets the distance from the diagram centre as multiples of half the diagonal of the bounding parallelepiped.
- `num_isolines` — number of isolines on the diagram.
- `padding` — value added on both sides of x, y and z ranges to ensure that ticks at extreme values are shown
  (`padding` is added to the normalized `aspect_ratio`).
- `interactive` — if `True`, use vedo’s interactive display; otherwise produce a static image.
- `diagram_size` — size used for the vedo `Plotter`.
- `kwargs` — dictionary of extra parameters forwarded directly to the `Plotter` object.

**Returns:** None, as the method either saves or displays the diagram as specified.

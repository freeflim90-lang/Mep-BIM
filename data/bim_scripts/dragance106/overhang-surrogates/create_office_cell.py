    """
    This method creates an office cell model with the attached overhang
    with <depth> m, that is positioned at <height> m above the window.
    As the office cell model is assumed to be a part of a lengthy building,
    whose window will extend the length of the building and will be shaded by the corresponding overhang,
    in the present office cell model the attached overhang is sufficiently extended to the left and the right of the window,
    to include parts of the overall overhang that influence the window of the office cell
    (one length of the office cell to the left and to the right).

    Besides the <height> and the <depth>,
    the method takes as parameters also the index <climate> of the location/climate file:
    0 = Dubai (zone 0B, extremely hot, dry)
    1 = Honolulu (zone 1A, very hot, humid)
    2 = Tucson (zone 2B, hot, dry)
    3 = San Diego (zone 3A, warm, marine)
    4 = New York (zone 4A, mixed, humid)
    5 = Denver (zone 5B, cool, dry)

    as well as the presence of <obstacle> on the southern side of the office cell:
    0 = no obstacles
    1 = medium obstacle from 11am to 2pm
    2 = high obstacle from 11am to 2pm
    3 = medium obstacle from 3pm to 5pm
    4 = medium obstacle from 8am to 10am and medium obstacle from 3pm to 5pm

    The office cell is rotated for <orientation> degrees away from true south
    (clockwise is positive; the obstacles are not rotated).

    Finally, the heating and the cooling setpoints are set at <heat_SP> and <cool_SP>, respectively.

    IMPORTANT NOTE:
    EnergyPlus will report errors if any two vertices are placed less than 0.01m apart.
    Height is thus set to at least 0.01m by taking min(height, 0.01).
    Depth, if less than 0.01, will skip generating the overhang.
